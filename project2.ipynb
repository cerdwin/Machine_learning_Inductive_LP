# # **Your task & Grading**
# ---
# The task is to complete an on-line learning FOL-based agent, which learns FOL clauses (disjunctions) relative to background knowledge (a set of ground literals). To accomplish this, you have to
# 
# *   implement methods in the *Support* class
# *   present at least one non-trivial learning scenario (i.e. list background knowledge, observations, target hypothesis) and describe what the agent learned (if it is a target hypothesis or not,...)
# 
# By non-trivial scenario, it is meant that there are at least two positive and negative observations, it can be represented in FOL (but not in propositional logic!), the scenario is original (not a variant of a lecture or a tutorial example), background knowledge is non-empty....
# 
# **Submission format**
#  
# *  Submit this notebook (within an archive) into brute.
# *  Do not change anything else than the things mentioned above (*Support* class, new cells for your scenario). In other words, do not change *FirstOrderEnvironment*, *GeneralizingFirstOrderAgent* class, and other files.
# *   Avoid hard-coded or too complex solutions.
# *   You MAY implement any auxiliary methods you want. You MAY import anything from the Python standard library but not from other libraries.
# *  Do not spam the standard output with debug messages.
# *  This is not teamwork! Work it out on your own, so you can be in a government one day.
# 
# **Grading**
# 
# In total, you can obtain 12.5 points.
# 
# *   4p *rlgg*
# *   3p *relativeReduction*
# *   3p *relativeThetaSubsumes*
# *   2.5p scenario
# 
# Due date is in three weeks (see deadline in BRUTE).
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 

# # **Usage**
# ---
# 
# Below, you find a minimalist guide for using the provided FOL library. It mirrors the standard FOL syntax (literals, atoms, functors, compound terms... all implemented in *logic.py*), so you can either construct a clause by creating every single object, or simply use a parser. 
# Bear in mind that variables start with an **uppercase** letter while constant and functors with a **lowercase** letter. 

# In[ ]:


c1 = Clause([Literal(Atom(Predicate("p", 2), [Constant("adam"), Variable("X")]), positive=False)])
c2 = parseClause("p(adam, fatherOf(adam)), !p(X, fatherOf(fatherOf(X)))")
print(c1)
print(c2)

# You may simply iterate over literals of a clause, terms of a literal or a composed term.

# In[ ]:


for literal in c2:
    print("{} literal {} has following arguments".format("positive" if literal.positive else "negative", literal))
    for term in literal:
        if isinstance(term, CompoundTerm):
            print("\tcompound term\t{}\n\t\twith function symbol\t{}".format(term, term.functor))
            for argument in term:
                print("\t\t{}".format(argument))
        else:
            print("\t{}\t{}".format(term.__class__, term))

# By the way, getting negation of literal is as symple as:

# In[ ]:


for literal in c2:
    print(literal.negation())

# The easiest way to apply a substitution to a clause is to create a substitution, i.e. a dictionary of terms indexed by variables.

# In[ ]:


c3 = parseClause("siblings(X, Y, Z)")
ss = c3.getVariables()
print("vars are:")
t = [i.name for i in ss]
print(t)
nums = []
for i in t:
    ne = t[0] + i
    nums.append(ne)
print(nums)
x = Variable("X")
y = Variable("Y")
z = Variable("Z")
issac = Constant("issac")
kain = Constant("kain")
substitution = {x: issac, y: kain, z: x}
print(c3.substitute(substitution))

# Finally, see the invocation of a theta-subsumption query.
# 

# In[ ]:


c4 = parseClause("p(X, Y)")
c5 = parseClause("p(Z, W)")
c4subsumesC5 = subsumes(c4, c5)
print("{}\t{}\t{}".format(c4, "theta-subsumes" if c4subsumesC5 else "does not theta-subsume", c5))
c5subsumesC4 = subsumes(c5, c4)
print("{}\t{}\t{}".format(c5, "theta-subsumes" if c5subsumesC4 else "does not theta-subsume", c4))

# The library is written in a functional-like manner, so using some stateful hacks could result in malfunctions.
